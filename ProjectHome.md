# Description #
A simple PHP class to read MP4 meta data from MP4 based files, such as MP4, M4V and F4V.

For Flash 7 & 8 FLV file format, check out the [php-flvinfo](http://code.google.com/p/php-flvinfo/) project.

# Wish list #
I mainly tested with F4V files encoded with:

  * Sorenson Squeeze 5
  * Adobe Adobe Media Encoder CS4
  * QuickTime Pro 7.6

I would be grateful if you can provide me (or test it with) MP4 files encoded with different encoders (and perhaps different codecs).

Code review is also welcome, and beware of the @todo tags in the code, as there are things to refactor.
